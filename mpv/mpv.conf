# A simple MPV configuration file to fix video playback issues.
# Place this file at ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf

# VIDEO OUTPUT DRIVER
# The "vo" option specifies the video output driver.
# "gpu-next" is the newer, recommended option.
# If "gpu-next" doesn't work, try "gpu" or a hardware-specific one.
# Uncomment the one you want to use.

#vo=gpu-next
vo=gpu
 # vo=vaapi # For Intel/AMD GPUs
# vo=vdpau # For NVIDIA GPUs

# HARDWARE DECODING
# The "hwdec" option enables hardware-accelerated video decoding.
# "auto-copy" is a good default, as it uses the best available method.
# If you still have problems, try forcing a specific method or disabling it.

hwdec=auto-copy
# hwdec=vaapi
# hwdec=vdpau
# hwdec=no # Disable hardware decoding completely

# MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS
# These are optional but highly recommended.

# Save the playback position when quitting a video.
save-position-on-quit=yes

# Automatically scale the OSD (On-Screen Display) based on your screen size.
# autofit-osd=yes
